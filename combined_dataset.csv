,,, Difference between SuperVised and Unsupervised Learning?,"Supervised learning is when you know the outcome and you are provided with the fully labeled outcome data while in unsupervised you are not
provided with labeled outcome data. Fully labeled means that each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer the algorithm should
come up with on its own. So, a labeled dataset of flower images would tell the model which photos were of roses, daisies and daffodils. When shown
a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label.
",
,,, What is Reinforcment Learning and how would you define it?,"A learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be
explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current
knowledge) .Semisupervised learning is also known as Reinforcment learning, in reinforcment learning each learning steps involved a penalty
criteria whether to give model positive points or negative points and based on that penalizing the model.
",
,,, What is Deep Learning ?,"Deep learning is defined as algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks(ANN).Deep learning
most probably focuses on Non Linear Analysis and is recommend for Non Linear problems regarding Artificial Intelligence.",
,,, Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?,"Since DL is a subset of ML and both being subset of AI.While basic machine learning models do become progressively better at whatever their
function is, they still need some guidance. If an AI algorithm returns an inaccurate prediction, then an engineer has to step in and make
adjustments. With a deep learning model, an algorithm can determine on its own if a prediction is accurate or not through its own neural network.
",
,,, Difference between Bias and Variance?,"Bias is definned as over simpliciation assumption assumed by the model,
Variance is definned as ability of a model to learn from Noise as well, making it highly variant.
There is always a tradeoff between these both, hence its recommended to find a balance between these two and always use cross validation to
determine the best fit.",
,,, What is Linear Regressions ? How does it work?,"Fitting a Line in the respectable dataset when drawn to a plane, in a way that it actually defines the correlation between your dependent
variables and your independent variable. Using a simple Line/Slope Formulae. Famously, representing f(X) = M(x) + b.
Where b represents bias
X represent the input variable (independent ones)
f(X) represents Y which is dependent(outcome).
The working of linear regression is Given a data set of n statistical units, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the
dependent variable y and the p-vector of regressors x is linear. This relationship is modeled through a disturbance term or error variable ε — an
unobserved random variable that adds ""noise"" to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. Thus the model takes the
form Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + ..... + BNXN
This also emplies : Y(i) = X(i) ^ T + B(i)
Where T : denotes Transpose
X(i) : denotes input at the I'th record in form of vector
B(i) : denotes vector B which is bias vector.",
,,, UseCases of Regressions:,"Poisson regression for count data.
Logistic regression and probit regression for binary data.
Multinomial logistic regression and multinomial probit regression for categorical data.
Ordered logit and ordered probit regression for ordinal data.",
,,, What is Logistic Regression? How does it work?,"Logistic regression is a statistical technique used to predict probability of binary response based on one or more independent variables.
It means that, given a certain factors, logistic regression is used to predict an outcome which has two values such as 0 or 1, pass or fail,
yes or no etc
Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable (target) is categorical.
For example,
To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)
Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)
Whether the transaction is fraud or not (1 or 0)
The prediction is based on probabilties of specified classes
Works the same way as linear regression but uses logit function to scale down the values between 0 and 1 and get the probabilities.",
,,, What is Logit Function? or Sigmoid function/ where in ML and DL you can use it?,"The sigmoid might be useful if you want to transform a real valued variable into something that represents a probability. While the Logit function
is to map probaliticvalues from -Inf to +inf to either real numbers representing True or False towards 1 or 0 (real number). This is commonly used
in Classification having base in  Logistic Regression along with Sigmoid based functions in Deep learning used to find a nominal outcome in a
layer or output of a layer.",
,,, What is Support Vector Machine ? how is it different from  OVR classifiers?,"Support Vector Machine is defineed as a Technique which is classification and regression model. Which uses hyper plan estimation and best hyper plane
fitting the estimate on linear lines drawn same a linear one. Although it can also work for non Linear using kernal tricks on SVM.
SVM is totally based on Marginal lines (with difference between two classes in the best way possible).
One Vs rest is the base classifier concept which is used in all the Ml algorithms which involves classification based on Class A vs Classes REst approach. Since here are only two heuristic approaches which are enhancment of Multiclass classificaton to make the binary classifier perform
well on multi class problems and solve the problem in hand.

The algorithms which uses OVO are:
1) Extreme learning Machines(ELM's)
2) Support Vector Machine(Classifiers)
3) K Nearest Neighbours.(for neighbouring classes based on distances)
4) Naive Bayes (based on MAP : Maximum Posterior )

6) Neural Networks (different nets)
",
,,, Types of SVM kernels,"Think of kernels as definned filters each for their own specific usecases.

4) Laplace RBF Kernel ( recommend for higher training set more than million)
5) Hyperbolic Tangent Kernel (neural network based kernel)
6) Sigmoid Kernel(proxy for Neural network)
7) Anova Radial Basis Kernel (for Regression Problems)",
,,, What is different type of Evauation metrics in Regression?,"There are multiple evaluation metrics for Regression Analysis
1) Mean Squared Error ( the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value)
2) Mean Absolute Error (Absolute of the Average difference)
",
,,, How would you define Mean absolute error vs Mean squared error?,"MAE : Use MAE when you are doing regression and don’t want outliers to play a big role. It can also be useful if you know that your distribution is multimodal, and it’s desirable to have predictions at one of the modes, rather than at the mean of them.
MSE : use MSE the other way around, when you want to punish the outliers.",
,,, How would you evaluate your classifier?,"A classifier can be evaluated through multiple case, having the base case around its confusion metrics and its attributes which are TP, TN , FP and FN. Along with the Accuracy metrics which can be derived alongside Precision, Recall scores.",
,,, What is Classification?,"Classification is defined as categorizing classes or entities based on the specified categories either that category exists or not in the respectable data. The concept is quite common for Image based classification or Data Based Classification. The answer in form of Yes or No;
alongside answers in form of types of objects/classes.",
,,, How would you differentiate between Multilabel and MultiClass classification?,"A multiclass defines as a classification outcome which can be of multiple classes either A or B or C but not   two or more than one.
While in MultiLabel classification, An outcome can be of either one or more than two classes i.e A or A and B or A and B and C.
",
,,, What is Confusion Matrics?,"A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of
the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is
usually called a matching matrix). Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class
while each column represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa).
The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes
(i.e. commonly mislabeling one as another).
",
,,, Which Algorithms are High Biased Algorithms?,"Bias is the simplifying assumptions made by the model to make the target function easier to approximate.
1) High bias algorithms are most probably Linear Algorithm, which are concerned with linear relationships or linear distancing. Examples are

4) Biased training sample
5) Overly strong regulariz",
,,, What is Gradient Decent? Difference between SGD and GD?,"Gradient Descent is an iterative method to solve the optimization problem. There is no concept of ""epoch"" or ""batch"" in classical gradient decent. The key of gradient decent are
* Update the weights by the gradient direction.
* The gradient is calculated precisely from all the data points.
Stochastic Gradient Descent can be explained as:
* Quick and dirty way to ""approximate gradient"" from one single data point.
* If we relax on this ""one single data point"" to ""a subset of data"", then the concepts of batch and epoch come.

,,, What is Randomforest and Decision Trees?,"A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event
outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by
constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean
prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Used to remove the Overfitting occured due to single Decision Trees.
",
,,, What is Process of Splitting?,Splitting up your data in to subsets based on provided data facts. (can come in handy for decision Trees),
,,, What is the process prunning?,"The Shortening of branches of Decision Trees is termed as Prunning. The process is done in case to reach the decision quite earlier than
expected. Reducing the size of the tree by turning some branch nodes into leaf nodes, and removing the leaf nodes under the original branch.",
,,, How do you do Tree Selection?,"Tree selection is mainly done from the following
1) Entropy
A decision tree is built top-down from a root node and involves partitioning the data into subsets that contain instances with similar
values (homogeneous). ID 3 algorithm uses entropy to calculate the homogeneity of a sample. If the sample is completely homogeneous the
entropy is zero and if the sample is an equally divided it has entropy of one.
Entropy(x) -> -p log(p) - qlog(q)  with log of base 2
2) Information Gain
The information gain is based on the decrease in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute. Constructing a decision tree is all about finding attribute that returns the highest information gain (i.e., the most homogeneous branches).
2.1) Calculate entropy of the target.
2.2) The dataset is then split on the different attributes. The entropy for each branch is calculated. Then it is added proportionally, to get total entropy for the split. The resulting entropy is subtracted from the entropy before the split. The result is the Information Gain, or decrease in entropy.
2.3) Choose attribute with the largest information gain as the decision node, divide the dataset by its branches and repeat the same process on every branch.",
,,, Pseudocode for Entropy in Decision Trees:,"'''
from math import log
def calculateEntropy(dataSet):
number = len(dataSet)
labelCounts = {}
for featureVector in dataSet:
currentLabel = featureVector[-1]
if currentLabel not in labelCounts.keys():
labelCounts[currentLabel] = 0
labelCounts[currentLabel] +=1

averaging of the tree outcome.",
,,, What is Gini Index? Explain the concept?,"The Gini Index is calculated by subtracting the sum of the squared probabilities of each class from one. It favors larger partitions.
Imagine, you want to draw a decision tree and wants to decide which feature/column you should use for your first split?, this is probably defined
by your gini index.",

for each class in branch:
Calculate probability of class in the given branch.

Weight each branch based on the baseline probability.
Sum the weighted gini index for each split.",
,,, What is the formulation of Gini Split / Gini Index?,"Favors larger partitions.
Uses squared proportion of classes.

,,, What is probability? How would you define Likelihood?,"Probability defines the percentage of Succes occured. or Success of an event. Can be described Chance of having an event is 70% or etc.
We suppose that the event that we get the face of coin in success, so the probability of success now is 0.5 because the probability of face and back of a coin is equal. 0.5 is the probability of a success.
Likelihood is the conditional probability. The same example, we toss the coin 10 times ,and we suppose that we get 7 success ( show the face) and
3 failed ( show the back). The likelihood is calculated (for binomial distribution, it can be vary depend on the distributions).
Likelihood(Event(success)) - > L(0.5|7)= 10C7 * 0.5^7 * (1-0.5)^3 = 0.1171
L(0.5 | 7) : means event likelihood of back( given number of successes)
10C7 -> Combination based on total 10 Events, and having the success outcome be 7 events
In general:
Event(X | Y)  -> C(Total Event| Success Event) * [(Prob of X) ^ (Success Event X)] * [(1 - Prob of X) ^ (1 - Success Event X)]",
,,, What is Entropy? and Information Gain ? there difference ?,"Entropy: Randomness of information being processed.

Cross Entropy: A measure from the field of information theory, building upon entropy and generally calculating the difference between two
probability distributions. It is closely related to but is different from KL divergence that calculates the relative entropy between two
probability distributions, whereas cross-entropy can be thought to calculate the total entropy between the distributions.

,,, How would you define precision() and Recall(True positive Rate)?,"Take a simple Classification example of ""Classifying email messages as spam or not spam""
Precision measures the percentage of emails flagged as spam that were correctly classified—that is, the percentage of dots to the right of the threshold line, it is also defined as % of event being Called at positive rates e.g
Precision = True Positive / (True Positive + False positive)
Recall measures the percentage of actual spam emails that were correctly classified

,,, What is difference between Preceptron and SVM?,"The major practical difference between a (kernel) perceptron and SVM is that perceptrons can be trained online (i.e. their weights can be updated
as new examples arrive one at a time) whereas SVMs cannot be. Perceptron is no more than hinge loss (loss function) + stochastic gradient descent (optimization).

2) L2 Regulization (Ridge Regression)
(adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. Here the highlighted part represents L2 regularization element.)

ML/DL models essentially learn a relationship between its given inputs(called training features) and objective outputs(called labels). Regardless of the quality of the learned relation(function), its performance on a test set(a collection of data different from the training input) is subject to investigation.
Most ML/DL models have trainable parameters which will be learned to build that input-output relationship. Based on the number of parameters each model has, they can be sorted into more flexible(more parameters) to less flexible(less parameters).
The problem of Underfitting arises when the flexibility of a model(its number of parameters) is not adequate to capture the underlying pattern in a training dataset. Overfitting, on the other hand, arises when the model is too flexible to the underlying pattern. In the later case it is said that the model has “memorized” the training data.

But it will never make them exactly zero. In other words, the *final model will include all predictors*. However, in the case of the **lasso**, the L1 penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be *exactly equal* to zero when the tuning parameter λ is sufficiently large.

There are 2 reasons: First, you can use several smaller kernels rather than few large ones to get the same receptive field and capture more spatial context, but with the smaller kernels you are using less parameters and computations. Secondly, because with smaller kernels you will be using more filters, you'll be able to use more activation functions and thus have a more discriminative mapping function being learned by your CNN",
,,, 29) Why do we need a validation set and test set? What is the difference between them? [[src](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/interview-questions)],"When training a model, we divide the available data into three separate sets:
- The training dataset is used for fitting the model’s parameters. However, the accuracy that we achieve on the training set is not reliable for predicting if the model will be accurate on new samples.
- The validation dataset is used to measure how well the model does on examples that weren’t part of the training dataset. The metrics computed on the validation data can be used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. However, every time we evaluate the validation data and we make decisions based on those scores, we are leaking information from the validation data into our model. The more evaluations, the more information is leaked. So we can end up overfitting to the validation data, and once again the validation score won’t be reliable for predicting the behaviour of the model in the real world.
- The test dataset is used to measure how well the model does on previously unseen examples. It should only be used once we have tuned the parameters using the validation set.
So if we omit the test set and only use a validation set, the validation score won’t be a good estimate of the generaliz",
,,, 30) What is stratified cross-validation and when should we use it? [[src](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/interview-questions)],"Cross-validation is a technique for dividing data between training and validation sets. On typical cross-validation this split is done randomly. But in stratified cross-validation, the split preserves the ratio of the categories on both the training and validation datasets.
For example, if we have a dataset with 10% of category A and 90% of category B, and we use stratified cross-validation, we will have the same proportions in training and validation. In contrast, if we use simple cross-validation, in the worst case we may find that there are no samples of category A in the validation set.
Stratified cross-validation may be applied in the following scenarios:
- On a dataset with multiple categories. The smaller the dataset and the more imbalanced the categories, the more important it will be to use stratified cross-validation.
- On a dataset with data of different distributions. For example, in a dataset for autonomous driving, we may have images taken during the day and at night. If we do not ensure that both types are present in training and validation, we will have generalization prob",
,,, 31) Why do ensembles typically have higher scores than individual models? [[src](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/interview-questions)],"An ensemble is the combination of multiple models to create a single prediction. The key idea for making better predictions is that the models should make different errors. That way the errors of one model will be compensated by the right guesses of the other models and thus the score of the ensemble will be higher.
We need diverse models for creating an ensemble. Diversity can be achieved by:
- Using different ML algorithms. For example, you can combine logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees.
- Using different subsets of the data for training. This is called bagging.
- Giving a different weight to each of the samples of the training set. If this is done iteratively, weighting the samples according to the errors of the ensemble, it’s called boosting.
Many winning solutions to data science competitions are ensembles. However, in real-life machine learning projects, engineers need to find a balance between ex",
,,, 32) What is an imbalanced dataset? Can you list some ways to deal with it? [[src](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/interview-questions)],"An imbalanced dataset is one that has different proportions of target categories. For example, a dataset with medical images where we have to detect some illness will typically have many more negative samples than positive samples—say, 98% of images are without the illness and 2% of images are with the illness.
There are different options to deal with imbalanced datasets:
- Oversampling or undersampling. Instead of sampling with a uniform distribution from the training dataset, we can use other distributions so the model sees a more balanced dataset.
- Data augmentation. We can add data in the less frequent categories by modifying existing data in a controlled way. In the example dataset, we could flip the images with illnesses, or add noise to copies of the images in such a way that the illness remains visible.
- Using appropriate metrics. In the example dataset, if we had a model that always made negative predictions, it would achieve a precision of 98%. There are other metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score that describe the accuracy of",

[[src](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/interview-questions)]","In supervised learning, we train a model to learn the relationship between input data and output data. We need to have labeled data to be able to do supervised learning.
With unsupervised learning, we only have unlabeled data. The model learns a representation of the data. Unsupervised learning is frequently used to initialize the parameters of the model when we have a lot of unlabeled data and a small fraction of labeled data. We first train an unsupervised model and, after that, we use the weights of the model to train a supervised model.
In reinforcement learning, the model has some input data and a reward depending on the output of the model. The model learns a policy that maximizes the reward. Reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to strategic games such as Go and even classic A",

Additionally, batch gradient descent, given an annealed learning rate, will eventually find the minimum located in it's basin of attraction.
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using a single sample. SGD works well (Not well, I suppose, but better than batch gradient descent) for error manifolds that have lots of local maxima/minima. In this case, the somewhat noisier gradient calculated using the reduced number of samples tends to jerk the model out of local minima into a region that hopefully is more optimal.

Bagging means that you take bootstrap samples (with replacement) of your data set and each sample trains a (potentially) weak learner. Boosting, on the other hand, uses all data to train each learner, but instances that were misclassified by the previous learners are given more weight so that subsequent learners give more focus to them during training.

,,, 57) When to use a Label Encoding vs. One Hot Encoding?,"This question generally depends on your dataset and the model which you wish to apply. But still, a few points to note before choosing the right encoding technique for your model:
We apply One-Hot Encoding when:
- The categorical feature is not ordinal (like the countries above)
- The number of categorical features is less so one-hot encoding can be effectively applied
We apply Label Encoding when:
- The categorical feature is ordinal (like Jr. kg, Sr. kg, Primary school, high school)
- The number of categories is quite large as one-hot encoding can lead to high memory consumption

,,, 59) What is t-SNE?,"t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised, non-linear technique primarily used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data. In simpler terms, t-SNE gives you a feel or intuition of how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space.
[[src]](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-t-sne-with-python-example-5a3a293108d1",
,,, 60) What is the difference between t-SNE and PCA for dimensionality reduction?,"The first thing to note is that PCA was developed in 1933 while t-SNE was developed in 2008. A lot has changed in the world of data science since 1933 mainly in the realm of compute and size of data. Second, PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique that seeks to maximize variance and preserves large pairwise distances. In other words, things that are different end up far apart. This can lead to poor visualization especially when dealing with non-linear manifold structures. Think of a manifold structure as any geometric shape like: cylinder, ball, curve, etc.
t-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance.

[[src]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426#:~:text=UMAP%20",
,,, 62) What is the difference between t-SNE and UMAP for dimensionality reduction?,"The biggest difference between the output of UMAP when compared with t-SNE is this balance between local and global structure - UMAP is often better at preserving global structure in the final projection. This means that the inter-cluster relations are potentially more meaningful than in t-SNE. However, it's important to note that, because UMAP and t-SNE both necessarily warp the high-dimensional shape of the data when projecting to lower dimensions, any given axis or distance in lower dimensions still isn’t directly interpretable in the way of techniques such as PCA.

,,," 64) Given that we want to evaluate the performance of 'n' different machine learning models on the same data, why would the following splitting mechanism be incorrect :","```
def get_splits():
df = pd.DataFrame(...)
rnd = np.random.rand(len(df))
train = df[ rnd < 0.8 ]
valid = df[ rnd >= 0.8 & rnd < 0.9 ]
test = df[ rnd >= 0.9 ]
return train, valid, test
#Model 1
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
train, valid, test = get_splits()
...
#Model 2
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
train, valid, test = get_splits()
...
```
The rand() function orders the data differently each time it is run, so if we run the splitting mechanism again, the 80% of the rows we get will be different from the ones we got the first time it was run. This presents an issue as we need to compare the performance of our models on the same test set. In order to ensure reproducible and consistent sampling we would have to set the random seed in advance or store the data once it is split. Alternatively, we could simply set the 'random_state' parameter in sklearn's train_test_split() function in order to get the same train, validation and test sets across different executions.
